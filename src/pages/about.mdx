## Our Story

Community House was founded as part of a broader experiment in alternative living and working models. The idea came from experiences with short-term rentals that often lacked reliable workspaces and genuine community connections. This inspired the creation of a space designed for living, working, and growing together.

We are one of many global experiments in coliving and coworking, inspired by the concepts found in **Network States** — new ways of living and organizing communities that emphasize both individual and collective growth. Our goal is to foster a shared sense of purpose while supporting personal development.

Coliving at Community House isn't just about saving on costs. It's about creating a sense of community and trust. By offering a stable, community-oriented living environment, we aim to provide an alternative to transient vacation rentals that supports longer-term relationships and collaborations.
