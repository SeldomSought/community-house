- **Movie Theatre** — Big screen for movie nights
- **House Tesla** — Shared vehicle for the community
- **Backyard Chickens** — Fresh eggs daily

## Room Options

We have rooms at different price points:

- **Small rooms** starting at $750/month

- **Master bedrooms** at $1,200/month

All rooms come fully furnished with month-to-month flexibility.
