# Welcome to The Fellowship

We're a community occupying three adjacent houses with a shared backyard in Travis Heights. It's kind of like renting a mansion together with three wings (and more privacy).

## The Property

We have 12 total bedrooms, three kitchens, multiple living rooms, a conservatory, loft, and more than half an acre of land. Enjoy serene, quiet, and natural surroundings while still being close to everything—3-10 minutes to downtown, Town Lake, South Congress, and East Austin by car.

## Amenities

- **1-5 Gbps Fiber Internet** — Work remotely without interruption
- **The Conservatory** — Spacious glass room for gathering, working, or music
- **Hot Tub & Cold Plunge** — Wellness and recovery
- **Theatre Room** — Projector and screen for movie nights and karaoke
- **Shared Self-Driving Tesla** — Community vehicle
- **Barbell Gym** — Full setup on-site
- **Backyard Chickens** — Fresh eggs from our mobile coop
- **Guest Loft** — Space for hosting visitors
- **Woodwork Shed** — Tools for projects
- **Fire Pits & Grill** — Outdoor entertaining

## The Community

We are healthy, conscientious people including grad students, artists, and technologists. We host gatherings like parties, performances, band practice, tea parties, salons, movie nights, karaoke, and regular "family dinners."

You're welcome to participate or not as you choose—there's always plenty of quiet space for introverts.

## Available Rooms

We have three rooms available from $750 to $1,250:
- One with an en suite bath
- Two with balcony access
- Utilities run $100-150 per person
