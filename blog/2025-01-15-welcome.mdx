# Welcome to Community House

We're excited to officially launch Community House — a new coliving and coworking space designed for modern professionals, digital nomads, and creatives who value community, flexibility, and growth.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why We Built This

The idea for Community House came from a simple observation: traditional housing options often fail to meet the needs of today's mobile workforce. Short-term rentals lack community. Long-term leases lack flexibility. And most living spaces aren't optimized for remote work.

We set out to create something different — a space that combines:

- **Comfortable living** with fully furnished private rooms
- **Professional workspaces** designed for productivity
- **Community connection** through curated events and shared experiences
- **Flexible terms** that adapt to your life, not the other way around

## What to Expect

As a resident of Community House, you'll have access to:

### Living Space
Thoughtfully designed private rooms with quality furniture, fresh linens, and all the comforts of home. Choose between shared or private bathroom options based on your preferences.

### Work Environment
A dedicated coworking space with ergonomic sit/stand desks, high-speed internet (1 Gbps fiber), and all the tools you need to do your best work.

### Community
Regular events including dinners, workshops, and networking opportunities. Our community manager is dedicated to helping you connect with fellow residents and the broader local community.

## Join Us

We're currently accepting applications for founding members. If you're interested in being part of something new, we'd love to hear from you.
